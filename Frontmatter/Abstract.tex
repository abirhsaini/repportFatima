This report provides a concise overview of my contributions during my internship at SQLI, aiming to obtain the title of State Engineer in Telecommunications and Information Technologies, with a specialization in Advanced Software Engineering for Digital Services from the National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. This project aimed to enhance an existing e-commerce platform for a client by integrating the Payconiq payment method specifically for the Belgian market, while also fixing various bugs to optimize system performance.

Considering the complexity of SAP Hybris, the realization of this project required the use of technologies such as JEE and Spring for development, as well as JUnit for testing. The integration of Payconiq was a major challenge, requiring particular attention to compatibility and performance to ensure a solution tailored to the specific needs of the Belgian market.
